# This is not an APL file. This is metadata for an APL package.
#
# The following information applies to the APL Package Manager release
# named "Percy".
#
# A package's metadata is a collection of keyword/value pairs.
#
# The metadata file defines keyword/value pairs. A keyword is the
# first word on a line, followed by a ':' character. The keyword maybe
# preceded by spaces. There must be no whitespace between the word
# and the ':' delimiter. The delimiter must be followed by at least
# one space.
#
# The value is the remaining text on the line (following the keyword
# and ':' character) after stripping leading and trailing spaces.
#
# A value may be extended across multiple lines. Each non-comment
# line which contains non-empty text is appended to the value.
# The platform-specific newline is preserved. The usual rule
# about stripping leading and trailing blanks applies even on
# continuation lines.
#
# Do not use tabs. Use spaces. (This limitation probably won't be
# lifted. Tabs simply aren't worth the trouble from the standpoint of
# presenting text in other contexts.)
#
# Use only the ISO-8859-1 character set. This is metatdata, not APL
# code. Putting extended characters into this file will cause
# problems, as the file may be processed through the APL's quad-AV.

# ================================================================

# The package's directory name, package_name, and package_prefix
# may all be different.

# A package name must contain only lowercase alphabetic characters
# plus (optionally) '_' and '-'. The first character of a package name
# must be alphabetic.
#
package_name: 

# The package manager confirms that prefixes won't collide when
# loading multiple packages into the APL workspace. A prefix should be
# composed entirely of alphabetic characters. Refer to API.md for
# additional rules about the use of prefixes in APL programs to be
# loaded by the package manager.
#
package_prefix: 

# The version is a sequence of up to four nonnegative integers. The
# numbers are limited three, three, four and four significant digits.
#
package_version: 

# A package may depend upon other packages, identified by package
# name. Use a separate entry for each package.
#
depends_on: 

# This is the date of the package's creation. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.
#
date: 

# Keywords can help to identify packages. Use one entry for each
# keyword.
#
keyword: 

# Identify yourself.
#
author: 
email: 
organization: 

# Additional authors should be identified by appending a sequential
# numeric suffix for each author. For example:
#
# author-1: 
# email-1: 
# organization-1: 
# author-2: 
# email-2: 
# ...

# Specify the package's license.
#
license: 

# Describe the package. Remember: You can split the description
# across several lines. Empty lines are removed.
#
description: 

# List documentation for the package. The file is a relative path; its
# components are space-separated. The name is for display purposes.
#
document_file: 
document_name: 

# Additional documents should be identified by appending a sequential
# numeric suffix. For example:
#
# document_file-1: 
# document_name-1: 
# document_file-2: 
# document_name-2: 
# ...

# The home repository tells us the package's origin.
